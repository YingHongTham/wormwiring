Notes to self
all paths are relative to the home folder of the website
(i.e. where the main index.html is)

the 'prototype' is just a way to add methods to a class

-the code for the Skeleton Neuron Diagrams is in
	apps/neuronMaps/include/mapViewer.js
-background color: in MapViewer.prototype.initGL,
	this.renderer.setClearColor(0xffffff);

importerApp is called and initialized by a window.onload callback
in the apps/neuronMaps/include/build_neuronMaps.js

#meshviewer is in css/importer.css
-id for canvas element in apps/neuronMaps/index.html
-apps/neuronMaps/include/importerapp.js finds this canvas element
-unclear what changing background-color would do
