Notes to self
all paths are relative to the home folder of the website
(i.e. where the main index.html is)

the 'prototype' is just a way to add methods to a class

-the code for the Skeleton Neuron Diagrams is in
	apps/neuronMaps/include/mapViewer.js
-background color: in MapViewer.prototype.initGL,
	this.renderer.setClearColor(0xffffff);

importerApp is called and initialized by a window.onload callback
in the apps/neuronMaps/include/build_neuronMaps.js

#meshviewer is in css/importer.css
-id for canvas element in apps/neuronMaps/index.html
-apps/neuronMaps/include/importerapp.js finds this canvas element
-unclear what changing background-color would do


TODOs
floating dialog when do cell selector
-apps/include/floatingdialog.js
-add close button

the synapse list viewer allows selecting multiple neurons,
but it only displays one

use jQuery for all those dialogs

deselecting cell in the Selector dialog doesn't clear the neuron,
would be nice to be able to clear individual neurons

in apps/php/dbaux, the database names are inconsistently capitalized
maybe because the databses are indeed as such
not very good

created a folder private and file config.ini in /var/www
meant to mimic the worms server.
it's the only thing that's not in the wormwiring-dev folder
should delete it as it has some password in plain text
