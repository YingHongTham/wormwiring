-the code for the Skeleton Neuron Diagrams is in
	apps/neuronMaps/include/mapViewer.js
-background color: in MapViewer.prototype.initGL,
	this.renderer.setClearColor(0xffffff);

importerApp is called and initialized by a window.onload callback
in the apps/neuronMaps/include/build_neuronMaps.js

#meshviewer is in css/importer.css
-id for canvas element in apps/neuronMaps/index.html
-apps/neuronMaps/include/importerapp.js finds this canvas element
-unclear what changing background-color would do


from ImporterApps:
selectedNeurons is expected to be an object of the form:
{
	Neurons : {
		ADAL : {
			value : "ADAL"
			visible : 0/1,
			plotted : 0/1,
			...
		},
		ADAR : {
			...
		},
		...
	}
	Muscles : {
		...
	}
}

currently testing out new library, temporarily have
the entire latest three.js in apps/include/three-latest
not git tracking it because it's huge

apps/neuronVolume/include/models is a symlink to
/usr/local/data/image_data/models
gets me thinking: why not also just create some static files
to store the skeleton maps??
store as json files..

TODOs
floating dialog when do cell selector
-apps/include/floatingdialog.js
-add close button

the synapse list viewer allows selecting multiple neurons,
but it only displays one

use jQuery for all those dialogs

deselecting cell in the Selector dialog doesn't clear the neuron,
would be nice to be able to clear individual neurons

in apps/php/dbaux, the database names are inconsistently capitalized
maybe because the databses are indeed as such
not very good

created a folder private and file config.ini in /var/www
meant to mimic the worms server.
it's the only thing that's not in the wormwiring-dev folder
should delete it as it has some password in plain text

add a save function


TODO:
-add volumetric data from n2y and harvard group
	--done, but current version doesn't seem to load n2y
-related: in apps/neuronMaps/include/mapViewer.js,
  check that parameters like this.XYScale = 0.05
  is correct, make proper documentation
-check cell list, seems mine differs from wormwiring.org..
	--checked, seems different indeed,
	--so I just copied from wormwiring.org

some errors in the SQL tables
-in synapsecombined, contin = 6226,
  have gap junction between PVQL and ADAL
  but their object numbers are the same = 87352.
  the correct object number for ADAL is 87392
  (get z1 of obj 87352 from display2 : 379,
  get contins of ADAL from contin (113, 5713)
  in display2 check continNum = 5713 and z1 = 379)
  FOR NOW,
  just going to ignore this (that's what has been done)
