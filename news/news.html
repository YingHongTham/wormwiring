1. New webmaster, Ying Hong Tham.  Please address queries to
yinghong.tham@einsteinmed.edu.
<br>
2. Additional data and or access has been added to available nematode
connectomics data.
<br>
3. In the <a href='/pages/emmonslab.html'>Emmons laboratory data page</a>
, the apps for drawing maps and synapse lists
from the MySQL tables has been updated and streamlined to run faster.
Some features have been added/improved on
for Skeleton Neuron Diagrams webapp:
<ul style='padding-left:10px'>
  <li>blazingly fast</li>
  <li>user can scale size of synapses</li>
  <li>synapses now appear next to skeleton</li>
  <li>typically on the surface of volume)</li>
  <li>multiple synapses may be selected to appear in Synapse Info section</li>
  <li>volumetric reconstruction now also visible in Skeleton Neuron Diagrams webapp</li>
  <li>aggregate volume showing all cells in a series (for N2U, JSH, n2y)</li>
  <li>interactive synapse list dialog allows easy navigation</li>
  <li>2D rendering of a reduction of the skeleton graph,</li>
  <li>chematic 'subway map' of skeleton diagram</li>
  <li>cells from different series can now be loaded simultaneously without errors</li>
  <li>translation can be applied to each series separately</li>
  <li>user may save/load a session</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
This new version of WormWiring has been created by Peter Sun, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Raymond Lee, Caltech and WormBase, and Maurice Volaski, Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  It represents an upgrade of the site's content and performance.  A major new feature is the capability of archiving release versions so that researchers may rely on the ability to reference data they may use.<br><br>
The major features of the previous site, which was created primarily by Christopher Brittin, remain unchanged, accessed by the present home page.  For example, please find the skeleton maps of C. elegans  neurons and links of synapses to electron micrographs under "Properties of single neurons."
