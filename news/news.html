This new version of WormWiring has been created by Peter Sun, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Raymond Lee, Caltech and WormBase, and Maurice Volaski, Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  It represents an upgrade of the site's content and performance.  A major new feature is the capability of archiving release versions so that researchers may rely on the ability to reference data they may use.<br><br>
The major features of the previous site, which was created primarily by Christopher Brittin, remain unchanged, accessed by the present home page.  For example, please find the skeleton maps of C. elegans  neurons and links of synapses to electron micrographs under "Properties of single neurons."
